# Python Assessment 2 - Way home for drunks
# UML Diagram

# Introduction
Having gone through the first assessment, we learnt about basic parts of Python ¨C variables, modules, functions, loops etc. Thereby, the second one is surely be the advanced type. We have five tasks to choose, and I choose to carry out the Drunk Guys task. 

This task is like a video game. It provides an existed 300*300 raster map as the background and requires us to generate 25 drunks from a pub (which locates at the centre of map) and let them move in a drunk way until they get one of their 25 houses. Their tracks should be displayed in some sort of ¡®density map¡¯ in order to get a deep look about how they move.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.7 environment, which can be established by installing Anaconda 3 on the computer. Link: anaconda.com/distribution

# Files/Directories
There is only one file needed to be input from outside into Python, which is the 300*300 environment raster file(.txt). In the file, the pub is denoted by 1, the houses by the numbers 10-250, and the empty spaces zeros. Another two file are Python-coding files(.py), the structure is the same with the first assessment ¨C one is model, and the other one is agentframework.
